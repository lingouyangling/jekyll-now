title: How Van Gogh’s Sunflowers Fooled My Neural Network
---

Yes! I did a computer vision project, and, it’s about art, and, it’s not perfect.   
I love art and I always wanted to do projects related to art. A while ago, I did a regression project on predicting the auction price of Picasso’s paintings (I will post it later, maybe) and when it came to a neural network project, this idea of recognizing paintings popped up immediately.   
So, like most deep learning beginners, I read through the “Holy Bible”, [Francios Chollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet)’s [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Python-Francois-Chollet/dp/1617294438/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1545876896&sr=8-3&keywords=deep+learning+with+python) and followed his approaches to carry out this project. I can’t imagine how much longer would it take without the book. Thank you so much, Chollet!

And back to the project. Basically, this project is to build a model that is able to accurately tell which painting belongs to which artist.   
## Data Collection
I collected 10,000 paintings of 10 artists from [Wiki Art](https://www.wikiart.org/) with the help of [Lucas David](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ld7/), a brilliant data scientist in Brazil, who built a [Wiki Art scraping tool](https://github.com/lucasdavid/wikiart). And the 10 artists are Chagall, Dali, Degas, Matisse, Monet, Picasso, Rembrandt, Renoir, Steinlen, and Van Gogh.

## Pre-processing
After a train-validation-test split, I used Pillow to resize all the images to 224 by 224 and used the ImageDataGenerator class from Keras to apply image augmentation (rotation, shift, shear, and zoom) to the train set.
## Models
The method to carry out the classification is to use transfer learning that combines a pre-trained convolutional base (VGG-16, RESNET and etc.) and a classifier with dense layers.
## Results
Among the pre-trained convolutional neural networks, the ResNet-50 achieved the best result: accuracy: 78% and top2 accuracy: 90%.   
On one hand, surprisingly, the model is smart enough to recognize the artists even their paintings vary in style. The following paintings exhibiting different style in are all created by Picasso, and the model correctly classified them as Picasso.

On the other hand, probably due to the diversity of Picasso’s paintings, the model tends to predict paintings with ambiguous style, especially those of Matisse and Degas, as Picasso. Another interesting fact is that the model gets confused between Monet and Van Gogh and predicts 10% of Monet’s paintings as Van Gogh.

Also, the nuances of art can really confuse neural networks. In my case, the model is fooled by Van Gogh’s Sunflowers (see figure below). It successfully predicts the left two as Van Gogh while thinks the right one as Picasso.

## Style Transfer Challenge
Lastly, I wanna play with my model more by adding a challenge for it. I applied a style transfer algorithm to a random photo I took from Brooklyn to mix it with the style of Van Gogh’s Starry Night and called my model to classify. To my delight, the model classified the mixed image as Van Gogh, which indicates that this model does not simply recognize the recurrent shapes or colors in an artist’s paintings but also captures the style patterns.

## Conclusion
In the course of this project, I have been constantly moved by the interaction between machine learning and art. Machines, in most cases, outperform humans but they also make the same mistakes we do. Art illustrates our most subtle and profound thoughts. Art speaks to our souls. To me, this reflects the promise of machine learning.
